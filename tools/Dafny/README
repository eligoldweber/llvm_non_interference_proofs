When upgrading to a new version of Boogie, it's important to increase the 
stack size it uses, since some of Boogie's internals use way too much for
some of our DafnyCC-generated files.

You can accomplish this using a Visual Studio Command Prompt and the command:

      editbin /stack:268435456 Boogie.exe

which gives it a 256 MB stack.
